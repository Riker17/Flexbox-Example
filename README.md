# Flexbox-Example

This repo is just a short preview of some of the awesome sorting you can do with flexbox! It is in no way, shape or form, everything this amazing tool has to offer. Simply start clicking the buttons and watch the boxes order themselves! The ordering is done with javascript adding the css elements to the containers.
